# Introduction

Mean reversion trading can be as simple as forecasting the level (or spread) we want to trade, and allocating relative to the forecast.
In the simple case of an  AR(1) model (or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process), we have a model such as
\\[ y_t = \alpha + \beta y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t \\]
where $y_t$ is the level (or spread) at time $t$, $\alpha$ is the long-term mean, $\beta$ is the autoregressive coefficient, 
and $\epsilon_t$ is a white noise error term (although we may have other terms in the model, such as a trend, or a seasonal, or some AR terms
to capture the short-run dynamics). In such a model,  if we recast it as \\(y_t = \beta (y_{t-1} - \frac{\alpha}{\beta}) + \alpha 
+ \epsilon_t\\), we can see that the model is mean-reverting if $|\beta| < 1$,
to the long-run level $\frac{\alpha}{\beta}$, and the speed of mean reversion is given by the coefficient $\beta$.  
As we hinted, allocation could be as simple as allocating a fixed amount to a trade: if the spread is above the long-term mean,(or the mean + threshold), we short one unit, and if it is below the long-term mean (or the mean - threshold), we buy one unit. But this is just the simplest case - let's get into the details.



We can forecast the level as:
$$\hat{y}_t = \alpha + \beta y_{t-1}

## Recommended Courses:

* [Fundamentals of Algorithmic Trading](https://rebrand.ly/ndzrcki), on the WBS/Quantshub Platform. This introductory course describes the Algo Trading Sector and common roles for quants, before discussing
the overall trading framework with a case study on crypto.
* [Algorithmic Trading Certificate(ATC): A Practitioner’s Guide](https://rebrand.ly/cbadu1x)
For a much more detailed discussion, the Algorithmic Trading Certificate, 
which is available on the WBS Platform, covers the topic in much more detail, 
including the statistical tests, the trading strategies, and the implementation details. It is available 
both as a self-paced course, and a hybrid course with live sessions.


Finally, I am working on a book on Algorithmic Trading, together with Dr Brian Healy, which will cover the topic in much more detail, including the statistical tests, 
the trading strategies, and the implementation in far more detail.

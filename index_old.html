	<p>Note that this class was devised initially as an PhD reading course in 2015, and later I taught online pre-recorded and live versions in Experfy and at QuantsHub. I then attempted to launch as an MSc course in 2017 with Julian Bonart. After his departure, it was launched with Paolo Barucca in 2018. We have run this course for over five years running - 2018/2019-2023/24. I am offering an intensive version of this course through WBSTraining, which will cover the practicalities of Algorithmic Trading including information needed to launch a fund.</p>

<p> I have been secondary supervisor to four PhD students who have finished. 
For three in particular, Dr Adriano Koshiyama (2020) and Dr Gabriel Borrageiro (2023), and Vincent Tan (2024, Oxford) I was the primary technical collaborator.  </p>

<p> I  advise MSc students during summers (maximum of 4 students each summer).  I am able to consider taking more PhD students, but I am not able to find funding for PhD students, so usually only take part-time PhDs. Note please that I work full-time so I will only consider PhD proposals that align closely with my interests.  My interests are in financial applications of ML and Stats, particulary in trading and investing. I am open to other research opportunities and have many outside collaborators working on areas such as optimal allocation for mid-frequency trading, optimal execution in high-frequency markets and the creation of both LOB and non-LOB alphas, and their impact on the order book, Random Matrix Theory for portfolio optimization, data augmentation  for causal inference in markets, optimal execution using reinforcement learning, ensemble methods for overparameterised shallow nets amongst other things </p>

## About Me
  - **Dr. Nick Firoozye** is a mathematician and finance professional with over 20 years of experience in research, structuring, and trading across buy and sell-side firms, including  Lehman Brothers, Deutsche Bank, Nomura, Goldman Sachs, and Citadel.  He specialises in areas ranging from Quant Strategy, RV Trading, to Asset Allocation.  Currently, Nick works at a mid-frequency trading prop firm based in Chicago. 
   As an Honorary Professor at University College London, Nick developed the Algorithmic Trading Strategies course, which he has taught PhD and MSc students since 2016.  He has also created and taught several successful online versions of the class. He has supervised eight PhD students researching machine learning for algorithmic trading and finance, with several now working in AI, systematic trading, and quant research. Over 600 students have successfully completed the Master's and online courses. 
   Nick co-authored the book _Managing Uncertainty, Mitigating Risk_, which addresses uncertainty in modelling financial crises. He holds a PhD from the Courant Institute, NYU, with postdoctoral positions at the University of Minnesota, Heriot-Watt University, the University of Bonn, and NYU. Before moving to Wall Street, Nick held a tenure-track Assistant Professorship at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.

 - **Research Interests**: 
Interested in ML, Computations Statistics, and AI, applied to Finance and especially to Algorithmic Trading. This necessarily involves time-series forecasting, using methods from Statistics, (Adaptive) Signal Processing, Econometrics, and Machine Learning. Also I have interests in portfolio allocation, and stochastic control / reinforcement learning for optimal execution. Recent areas of interest have been in random matrix theory for portfolio analysis, RL for optimal execution, bagging and boosting over-parameterised shallow nets for online learning to forecast prices in near real-time.
In summary, I am interested in 
    - Financial Time-Series Analysis  
    - Time-series forecasting for low SNR, highly non-stationary signals.
    - Change-point detection / regime-switching
    - Data Augmentation
    - Overparameterised Models and Ensembling
    - Adaptive forecasting and State-space models
    - Kernel methods and DNN for forecasting 
    - Online Learning & Adaptive Filtering, Fast Algorithms
    - Optimal Allocation
    - Order book simulation, Optimal Order Placement, Optimal Market Making
    - Algorithmic Trading, High Frequency Trading, Market Microstructure, 
    - Reinforcement Learning / Stochastic Control
    - Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Statistical Learning, Bayesian Methods

 - **Other interests**: 
    - Calculus of Variations and Nonlinear PDE, Elasticity
    - Image Processing
    - Islamic Law and Economics
    - Eurozone Crisis, Financial Crises, and the role of uncertainty in financial markets
    - Fixed Income derivatives, RV strategies, Macro Trading.

## Courses - Live, Hybrid, and Online
### University Teaching
  - [COMP0051: Algorithmic Trading MSc Course](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/algorithmic-trading-COMP0051) :  Based on my previous online courses and further extended, 
 this course covers the foundations of algorithmic trading, including market microstructure, trading strategies, and risk management. Offered at 
 UCL for MSc Students every Spring Term since 2018. Co-teacher: Dr Paolo Barucca.
  - Note that this class was devised initially as an PhD reading course in 2015, and later taught online 
 pre-recorded and live versions in Experfy, with live classes at WBS Training and at QuantsHub. 
 I then attempted to launch as an MSc course in 2017 with Julian Bonart. After his departure for Citadel, 
 it was launched with Paolo Barucca in 2018. We have run this course for over five years running - 2018/2019-2023/24. I am offering an intensive version of this course through WBSTraining, which will cover the practicalities of Algorithmic Trading including information needed to launch a fund.</p>

### Online Hybrid and Pre-recorded Teaching
  - [Algorithmic Trading Certificate (ATC): A Practitioner's Guide](https://www.wbstraining.com/events/algorithmic-trading-certificate/) 
in WBS Training. Co-taught with Dr Brian Healy (UCL). Online course offered in medium sized cohorts.
  This course is based on my MSc course and covers the foundations of algorithmic trading, 
 including market microstructure, trading strategies, and risk management.
  - [Fundamentals of Algorithmic Trading](https://quantshub.com/content/fundamentals-algorithmic-trading): 
 An introductory self-paced course, covering the industry and the basics of algorithmic trading.

 Coauthored with Fauziah Ariff. Wiley 2017.
  - [Quantitative Trading: A Systematic Approach] - A comprehensive guide to algorithmic trading, covering the foundations of quantitative trading strategies across styles and timescales. 
 Together with Dr Brian Healy, under contract, CRC Press, expected publication in 2027.

## About Me

<div class="about-section">
<img src="images/selfie.jpg" alt="NBF Headshot" class="profile-image" />
 **Dr. Nick Firoozye** is a mathematician and finance professional with over 20 years of experience in research, structuring, and trading across buy and sell-side firms, including  Lehman Brothers, Deutsche Bank, Nomura, Goldman Sachs, and Citadel.  He specialises in areas ranging from Quant Strategy, RV Trading, to Asset Allocation.  Currently, Nick works at a mid-frequency trading prop firm based in Chicago. 

 As an Honorary Professor at University College London, Nick developed the Algorithmic Trading Strategies course, which he has taught PhD and MSc students since 2016.  He has also created and taught several successful online versions of the class. He has supervised eight PhD students researching machine learning for algorithmic trading and finance, with several now working in AI, systematic trading, and quant research. Over 600 students have successfully completed the Master's and online courses. 

 Nick co-authored the book _Managing Uncertainty, Mitigating Risk_, which addresses uncertainty in modelling financial crises. He holds a PhD from the Courant Institute, NYU, with postdoctoral positions at the University of Minnesota, Heriot-Watt University, the University of Bonn, and NYU. Before moving to Wall Street, Nick held a tenure-track Assistant Professorship at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.

 - **Research Interests**: 
Interested in ML, Computations Statistics, and AI, applied to Finance and especially to Algorithmic Trading. This necessarily involves time-series forecasting, using methods from Statistics, (Adaptive) Signal Processing, Econometrics, and Machine Learning. 

 Also I have interests in portfolio allocation, and stochastic control / reinforcement learning for optimal execution. Recent areas of interest have been in random matrix theory for portfolio analysis, RL for optimal execution, bagging and boosting over-parameterised shallow nets for online learning to forecast prices in near real-time.

In summary, I am interested in 
  - Financial Time-Series Analysis  
  - Time-series forecasting for low SNR, highly non-stationary signals.
  - Change-point detection / regime-switching
  - Data Augmentation
  - Overparameterised Models and Ensembling
  - Adaptive forecasting and State-space models
  - Kernel methods and DNN for forecasting 
  - Online Learning & Adaptive Filtering, Fast Algorithms

### Awards and Grants
  - **NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship**, 1990-1993
  - **Courant Institute 50th Jubilee Fellow**, 1986
  - **Wolfson Prize in Economics, Short-listed**, 2012 - [Planning for an orderly break-up of the European Monetary Union](https://www.academia.edu/36748175/Wolfson_Prize_Shortlisted_Article_Planning_for_an_orderly_break_up_of_the_European_Monetary_Union).
Note: Despite the obvious agenda of the prize, our conclusion was there was no such thing as an orderly breakup!
  - FSA _Dear CRO_ letter of 2010 asking for planning around risk-scenarios for Eurozone breakup and Greek Exit, prompted by my paper
on the legal aspects of Eurzone breakup [Currency risk in a Eurozone break-up: Legal Aspects](https://www.academia.edu/30008471/Currency_risk_in_a_Eurozone_break_up_Legal_Aspects)
(``Scariest paper we have _ever_ seen. Went round the FSA like wildfire'')). 

### Education:
  - PhD, Courant Institute, NYU, 1990, advisor: Prof Bob Kohn, Nonlinear Elasticity, Calculus of Variations.
  - MS, Courant Institute, NYU, 1987.
  - BS, Harvey Mudd College, 1986, advisor: Prof Stavros Busenberg.

## Courses - Live, Hybrid, and Online
### University Teaching
  - [COMP0051: Algorithmic Trading MSc Course](
 https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/algorithmic-trading-COMP0051) :  Based on my previous online courses and further extended, 
 this course covers the foundations of algorithmic trading, including market microstructure, trading strategies, and risk management. Offered at 
 UCL for MSc Students every Spring Term since 2018. Co-teacher: Dr Paolo Barucca.
  - Note that this class was devised initially as an PhD reading course in 2015, and later taught online 
 pre-recorded and live versions in Experfy, with live classes at WBS Training and at QuantsHub. I then attempted to launch as an MSc course in 2017 with Julian Bonart. After his departure for Citadel, 
 it was launched with Paolo Barucca in 2018. We have run this course for over five years running - 2018/2019-2023/24. I am offering an intensive version of this course through WBSTraining, which will cover the practicalities of Algorithmic Trading including information needed for setting up the quant functions in a fund.

### Online Hybrid and Pre-recorded Teaching

* [Algorithmic Trading Certificate(ATC): A Practitioner's Guide](https://rebrand.ly/cbadu1x) in WBSTraining. Co-taught with Dr Brian Healy (UCL). Online course offered in medium sized cohorts.
  This course is based on my MSc course and covers the foundations of algorithmic trading, 
 including market microstructure, trading strategies, and risk management. Students who have taken this course
 have gone on to new roles in sell-side and buy-side quant and algo trading functions, or used their new skills to manage their PAs.

* [Fundamentals of Algorithmic Trading](https://rebrand.ly/ndzrcki): An introductory self-paced course, covering the industry and the basics of algorithmic trading.
